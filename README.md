Welcome to my Github Pages repository. In here I will keep all of my open-source web projects. I am currently working on the game ONEMOREKILL and a w.i.p. open-source math problems site appropriately named MATH. In each folder there will be it's associated repo and maybe even a link to an actual repo that you can clone.   


# ONEMOREKILL

An engine for bare bones' first ever game! It is fairly simplistic so it shouldn't take a year to complete. This engine is made in javascript. It is open source so feedback and tweaks are very much appreciated! We look forward to testing out the skills we've learned over the years. 

# MATH

Repo will be up soon, getting started on this.
